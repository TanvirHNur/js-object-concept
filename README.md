Javascript Object concept
Your JavaScript tree is slowly growing. And the bigger the tree, the more it will move in the wind. So it is very important to tighten the waist without fear in the movement of the wind. Then even if the wind moves you, you will enjoy that movement without being afraid. If the wind blows, you will enjoy it like a swing. And the two will not be afraid to play a little unexpected move once. Because you have been understanding for so long. No matter how difficult things are. With a little time, things will get in line.


Today's module

First of all there are some more interesting things related to objects. Especially how many objects can be declared. That kind of discussion will then come about how the function (doing something with the object) as the property of the object does it. Giving a function as a property in this object is called 'method'. A little light discussion on that method at the beginning. And some things will come in the middle. They need to know now.
In particular, how to get the names of the properties of an object with keys. How to get only mangula with values. How to get both key and value with entries. Also how to delete a property from the object. And one thing you need to know is how to loop all the properties of an object.

Advanced Concept

This is an advanced module. So there will be several advanced videos. You must see them. If you don't understand, mark it for now. Will be able to see later. These advanced topics include object bind, call and apply. I will proudly discuss these three things. Then there is a little more discussion about scope.
This time we will discuss about window, global variable, global scope type things. This will be followed by some guidelines on this, the most confusing keyword in JavaScript. You too will be confused with this keyword. And will not understand everything. But if you understand one or two things. Even so, keep moving forward.



The following three things must be known as Junior web dev

1. Methods can be added to objects.

2. How to apply keys and values ​​in objects

3. How to loop in all the properties of the object can be shown as the name and value output of that property.

Interview questions

Today's module is a little difficult because the last things to ask in the interview from time to time. So what interview questions can come from today's module. (Even if you can't answer these questions now, there is no problem. You will see later. The video will have lifelong access)

1. (Advanced) How to compare two objects in JavaScript

2. (Advanced) What is the difference between bind, call, apply?

3. (Advanced) How this keyword works in JavaScript

4. arrow What is the difference between a function and a regular function?



By no means do I want to convey that I recommend for the mother to be inactive. But I hope you know the names today. If necessary, watch today's video 2-3 times. Then maybe 50% will understand things. And the names will stay in your head even if it is a little bit. So that after a few days, if you go to revise this module again, you will understand a little better.

 

Because no one will ask if you understand once or twice. Instead, everyone will ask whether you know it or not.
Being summarized, it will be done if stuck.

 

What you do when you do not want to do anything, will define who you will become.
